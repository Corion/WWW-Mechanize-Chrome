WWW::Mechanize::Chrome::Cookbook - Getting things done with WWW::Mechanize::Chrome

=head1 Chrome versions

You can find various current Chrome builds at
L<https://chromium.woolyss.com/> .

The recommended approach to automation is to save a Chrome / Chromium version
and disable automatic updates so you can update at a defined point in time
instead and keep the change to your automation under control.

=head1 Web Application Testing with Chrome

=head2 Rationale

If you have an application with complex Javascript, you may want to do end to
end tests using WWW::Mechanize::Chrome. You can run your server application and
your test program in the same process if your server application can be run
under PSGI, as most web frameworks do.

Having all data within one process makes it very easy to fudge configuration
values or database entries at just the right time.

=head2 Initializing the web server in your test script

You will need to use a PSGI web server written in Perl that supports event
loops also supported by WWW::Mechanize::Chrome. L<Twiggy> is one such server.
The setup for Twiggy is as follows:

  use Twiggy::Server;
  use File::Temp 'tempdir';
  
  my $port = 5099;
  my $server = Twiggy::Server->new(
      host => '127.0.0.1',
      port => $port,
  );
  
  # Dancer specific parts
  $ENV{DANCER_APPHANDLER} = 'Dancer::Handler::PSGI';
  my $handler = Dancer::Handler->get_handler();
  Dancer::_load_app('App::mykeep');
  my $app = $handler->psgi_app();
  
  # Rest of Twiggy setup
  $server->register_service($app);
  
  # Fudge the config as appropriate for our test
  Dancer::config()->{mykeep}->{notes_dir} = tempdir(
      CLEANUP => 1,
  );
  
  my $mech = WWW::Mechanize::Chrome->new(
  );
  my $res = $mech->get("http://127.0.0.1:$port");
  ok $res->is_success, "We can request the page";
