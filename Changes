    + Support ->reload on Chrome v66+ by adding --disable-prompt-on-repost
      This globally disables the prompting on repost for the process. If you
      need to test for these prompts, add
        disable_prompt_on_repost => 0
      to the options for the WWW::Mechanize::Chrome object. To my knowledge,
      there is no way to programmatically find whether Chrome is prompting for
      a repost or not. See also
          https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=804371
    + Support ->getRequestPostData() to retrieve the data when sending a POST
	  request

    + IO::Async / Net::Async support
      This was mostly held back by me not understanding the API of
      Net::Async::WebSocket::Protocol. This needs
      Net::Async::WebSocket::Client 0.12 (or higher) installed.
    + Workarounds in tests for new, incompatible Chrome behaviour

    ! ->js_errors() now only returns error messages
    ! ->js_console_entries returns all entries in the browser console
    ! Errors in JS code from ->eval_in_page are now fatal errors in Perl too

    + Implemented file downloads and their storage for v62 and v63
      You can't find out the name a file was saved as, and you can't find out
      when the download is done.
      Chrome v64 doesn't notify us at all about downloads.
    ! Redid success/failure logic of responses
      We try harder to associate a response with something that we actually
      initiated.
    ! Selecting different backends now actually works

    ! Fix timers firing or not
    ! Implement a workaround for Chrome (not) navigating
      This workaround means sleeping 0.1s to see whether the notification comes
      in from Chrome after the "navigation complete" message has arrived.
      Ideally we will find a way to make Chrome tell us when it will perform
      HTTP transactions instead of having to wait.

    + More robust handling of Chrome disconnects
      It seems that Chromium 62+ disconnects all clients when a tab is closed
