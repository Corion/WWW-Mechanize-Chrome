0.16 20180623
    + Added ->is_visible, ->wait_until_visible and ->wait_until_invisible
    + Better way to find the system browser by default
      This can be overridden by explicitly specifying the executable to use
    . Rename ->agent_async() to ->agent_future()
    . Add ->callFunctionOn_future() and ->callFunctionOn()
    ! "start_url" now actually gets you the first URL
    ! Fixed ->viewport_size() to actually work
    . Experimental prototype of self-implemented Save Page As feature
      (undocumented)

0.15 20180530
    . Added ->links() method, pasted from WWW::Mechanize::PhantomJS
      Thanks to Alain Rioux for spotting
    + Add some more command line switches to disable more background behaviour
      of Chrome by default:
        background_networking
        client_side_phishing_detection
        component_update
        hang_monitor
        prompt_on_repost
        sync
        web_resources
        default_apps
        infobars
        default_apps
        popup_blocking
      You can re-enable this by passing a true value to the option in
      the constructor

0.14 20180527
    + The "tab" parameter to ->new() was documented
    ! The "reuse" parameter to reconnect to an existing Chrome instance is
      not needed anymore if you pass in a true value for the "tab" parameter.
    ! Downloads are now detected in a better way on Chrome 66+
      This needed some general rework in how responses are treated, so please
      retest your scripts and send me failing tests if a case has now become
      time-critical.

0.11 20180414
    + Support ->reload on Chrome v66+ by adding --disable-prompt-on-repost
      This globally disables the prompting on repost for the process. If you
      need to test for these prompts, add
        disable_prompt_on_repost => 0
      to the options for the WWW::Mechanize::Chrome object. To my knowledge,
      there is no way to programmatically find whether Chrome is prompting for
      a repost or not. See also
          https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=804371
    + Support ->getRequestPostData() to retrieve the data when sending a POST
	  request
    + Support ->searchInResponseBody() to search in a response body without
	  retrieving the body to Perl space. This doesn't work reliably in my
	  experience, as Chrome seems to forget response bodies rather quickly.
    + outerHTML is now a gettable property
	+ The User-Agent string can be set in the constructor
	+ Fixes for Chrome v67 when retrieving file:// resources
	  These fixes might have unwanted side-effects for other versions of Chrome
	  and other protocols, but the test suite doesn't show any of them. If this
	  change breaks your workflow, please submit a (failing) test case.

    + Implemented file downloads and their storage for v62 and v63
      You can't find out the name a file was saved as, and you can't find out
      when the download is done.
      Chrome v64 doesn't notify us at all about downloads.
    ! Redid success/failure logic of responses
      We try harder to associate a response with something that we actually
      initiated.

    ! Fix timers firing or not
    ! Implement a workaround for Chrome (not) navigating
      This workaround means sleeping 0.1s to see whether the notification comes
      in from Chrome after the "navigation complete" message has arrived.
      Ideally we will find a way to make Chrome tell us when it will perform
      HTTP transactions instead of having to wait.
