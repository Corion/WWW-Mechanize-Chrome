    ! Fix timers firing or not
    ! Implement a workaround for Chrome (not) navigating
      This workaround means sleeping 0.1s to see whether the notification comes
      in from Chrome after the "navigation complete" message has arrived.
      Ideally we will find a way to make Chrome tell us when it will perform
      HTTP transactions instead of having to wait.
