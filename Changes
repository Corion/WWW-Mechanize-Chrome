0.34 2019-06-15
    * Add ->remove_listener to $mech to explicitly remove event listeners.
      The usual way is RAII-style, letting your event listener simply go out of
      scope. This is for times where you can't let your event listener go out
      of scope.
    * Be more defensive to avoid (unweak) circular references. This should clean
      out more memory leaks whenever a callback is set or a Future is returned
      from W:M:C.
    * Fix (partial code for) saving a page. I don't know how this test ever
      passed. This adresses RT #129821.

0.33 2019-05-29
    * Actually call waitpid to make sure our Chrome processes go away properly
      and to not accumulate zombies. Sent by Felipe Sologuren. This fixes
      RT #129805, thanks!
    * Fix memory leak caused by non-weakening of references in ->add_listener
        Diagnosed and reported by Felipe Sologuren. This fixes RT #129808,
        thanks!
    * Add ->event accessor to Chrome::DevToolsProtocol::EventListener, suggested
      by Felipe Sologuren, thanks!

0.32 2019-05-29
    * ->update_html now stringifies its argument. This allows to pass in objects
      with stringification overload instead of having to do the stringification
      yourself. Addresses GH #42.
    * Rename HTTP::Cookies::Chrome to HTTP::Cookies::ChromeDevTools to avoid
      the name clash.

0.31 2019-05-25
    * Silence HTTP::Cookies::Chrome debug output left over
    * ->eval() now takes options on whether object references or JSON-serialized
      data should be returned. This allows you to reference the "window"
      object, for example.
      Currently, these object references are kept as hashrefs instead of
      objects, and the handling needs to become more transparent with respect to
      the Chrome API, but that is planned for later versions.

0.30 2019-05-17
    * Disable the Host: header test for Chromer 76+, as this raises an error
      in those versions instead of just not working.
      I guess this is progress.

0.29 2019-04-23

      (like frontier.com )

    * Documentation improvements by SDONLEY
    * Up Future prerequisite to 0.35, earlier versions lack the features
      the module uses

0.27 2018-12-23
    * Properly handle Page.navigatedWithinDocument instead of raising an error.
      The synthetic response object doesn't help much, but on the other side,
      it's much better than raising an error and stopping the script.
      Reported by Steve Dondley, Github issue GH #34

0.26 2018-12-09
    * Actually do something if we timeout when connecting to Chrome.
      The main cause of the connetcion to Chrome failing is that there already
      is a non-devtools instance of Chrome running and is brought to the
      foreground instead of a new DevTools-enabled instance being launched.
      The best workaround is to launch it as

      use File::Temp 'tempdir';
      # create a fresh Chrome every time
      my $mech = WWW::Mechanize::Chrome->new(
          data_directory => tempdir(CLEANUP => 1 ),
      );

    * More log output in Chrome::DevToolsProtocol
    * Now testing up to Chrome 73
    * ExtUtils::MakeMaker minimum version 5.52_01, contributed by LorenzoTa
    * Fix the test skip counts for several tests

0.25 2018-11-23
    * Added one stray test to the distribution
    * Rework of the documentation, thanks to Harald Joerg
      This is a result of the PRC, thank you very much!
    * No code changes, no need to upgrade

0.24 2018-11-19

    * Slight logging improvements for the Net::Async backend

      is largely undocumented.

      This kind of navigation does not work on Chrome 64 and Chrome 59.

    . Added installation instructions for MacOS / OSX, contributed by Sdonley
    . Added default path on MacOS for using the default Chrome executable
    . Automatic testing for OSX on Travis CI is now enabled
    . We now always launch Chrome / Chromium with --no-zygote and --no-sandbox

          no_zygote => 0,
          no_sandbox => 0,
      to the constructor
    . Skip constructor failure tests for Perl < 5.014
      $@ is not always preserved when a destructor calls eval{} on those
      versions of Perl.
    . Add ->infinite_scroll as experimental API, together with ->scroll_to_bottom

0.16 2018-06-23
    + Added ->is_visible, ->wait_until_visible and ->wait_until_invisible
    + Better way to find the system browser by default
      This can be overridden by explicitly specifying the executable to use
    . Rename ->agent_async() to ->agent_future()
    . Add ->callFunctionOn_future() and ->callFunctionOn()
    ! "start_url" now actually gets you the first URL

    + The "tab" parameter to ->new() was documented
    ! The "reuse" parameter to reconnect to an existing Chrome instance is
      not needed anymore if you pass in a true value for the "tab" parameter.
    ! Downloads are now detected in a better way on Chrome 66+
      This needed some general rework in how responses are treated, so please
      retest your scripts and send me failing tests if a case has now become
      time-critical.

0.11 2018-04-14
    + Support ->reload on Chrome v66+ by adding --disable-prompt-on-repost
      This globally disables the prompting on repost for the process. If you
      need to test for these prompts, add
        disable_prompt_on_repost => 0
      to the options for the WWW::Mechanize::Chrome object. To my knowledge,
      there is no way to programmatically find whether Chrome is prompting for
      a repost or not. See also
          https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=804371
    + Support ->getRequestPostData() to retrieve the data when sending a POST
	  request
    + Support ->searchInResponseBody() to search in a response body without
	  retrieving the body to Perl space. This doesn't work reliably in my
	  experience, as Chrome seems to forget response bodies rather quickly.
    + outerHTML is now a gettable property
	+ The User-Agent string can be set in the constructor
	+ Fixes for Chrome v67 when retrieving file:// resources
	  These fixes might have unwanted side-effects for other versions of Chrome
	  and other protocols, but the test suite doesn't show any of them. If this
	  change breaks your workflow, please submit a (failing) test case.
