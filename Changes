    + Implemented file downloads and their storage for v62 and v63
	  You can't find out the name a file was saved as, and you can't find out
	  when the download is done.
	  Chrome v64 doesn't notify us at all about downloads.
	! Redid success/failure logic of responses
	  We try harder to associate a response with something that we actually
	  initiated.
	! Selecting different backends now actually works

    ! Fix timers firing or not
    ! Implement a workaround for Chrome (not) navigating
      This workaround means sleeping 0.1s to see whether the notification comes
      in from Chrome after the "navigation complete" message has arrived.
      Ideally we will find a way to make Chrome tell us when it will perform
      HTTP transactions instead of having to wait.

    + More robust handling of Chrome disconnects
      It seems that Chromium 62+ disconnects all clients when a tab is closed
    ! ->get now always waits for an HTTP response

    ! The "profile" option now really uses the profile, not the data directory.
    + New option "data_directory" to set the base data directory.
    + We run all tests with a temporary user now instead of the default user
      that might be your current Chrome user
    + Tests now run headless by default
    + The backend event loop can be selected from the environment
